	A world being hosted for friends, outside the server: where its socket
	can be reached, and the packets that let joiners in.

	Nothing here holds the world up: it's made as the server starts, and
	learns the rest alongside. A worker resolves the STUN servers and asks the
	router to open the port (UPnP); step() sends STUN requests from the
	server's socket, whose answers come back through the connection's stray
	handler (stray(), on its receive thread). The same requests, repeated,
	keep the router's mapping alive and notice if it changes.

	Once a frame it also waits on ArcLabs for knocks — joiners on their way,
	with their own public address — and sends packets toward each for a few
	seconds, so this side's router expects the joiner's (hole punching).
