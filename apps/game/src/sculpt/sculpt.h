	Sculpt: the tools in hand (sprint 45), working the world where it stands
	at any size from a sixteenth to a few blocks. A stroke is a tool, a
	size, where it's pointed and dig or place: the world's sixteenths it
	takes or fills. The server applies it (Sculptor); the client outlines
	it before the click.

	Sprint 75: structure. A frame or truss is drawn as a box is, its
	members the size thick (a flat one, clicked or not pulled out, is a
	chassis); a beam from one point to another across the face.

	A shape is drawn by its footprint (sprint 50): dragged out on the face
	it starts on, from the sixteenth pointed at to `to` (a box corner to
	corner; a round one from its middle out, sprint 65); the size is how far
	it goes, out of the face (adding) or into it (cutting, painting). Clicked, the
	footprint's a square of the size. Each tool fills that box its own way:
	the box whole, the ellipse across it (a cylinder), tapering to a point
	(a cone), the ellipsoid in it (a sphere).
