/*
	The world as a sandbox: its own blocks run the shared physics (physics.h)
	wherever something is happening — a fire in a hole, a clay kiln, lava
	meeting water — and sleep everywhere else.

	- Awake blocks hold their matter and temperature and run reactions,
	  conduction and gas exchange with their neighbours.
	- An asleep block is what its kind of block is made of, at the weather's
	  temperature. Heat flowing into a solid one wakes it once it has warmed
	  enough to matter; asleep air is the room (oxygen in, smoke out).
	- When an awake block's matter changes enough, the block changes: to the
	  kind registered as the form of what now fills it (wood → charcoal →
	  air, wet clay → fired clay, water → ice).
	- A settled block (at the weather's temperature, nothing reacting, its
	  matter what its kind is made of) goes back to sleep.

	The world itself is reached through `Ground`, so this has no engine
	dependencies (and tests run it over a map of their own).
