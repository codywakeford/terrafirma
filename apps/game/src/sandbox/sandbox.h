/*
	A sandbox: a tiny piece of the universe, a few blocks across, simulated
	with the game's own physics so the wiki can show what happens instead of
	saying it. Not a toy: every block is a matter::Mixture (the Reactor's,
	the furnace's), and between blocks:

	- heat conducts by each substance's conductivity in its state, and
	  leaves the outer faces to the room by convection and radiation;
	- gases mix, hot gas rises, gas made by a reaction pushes out and gas a
	  reaction uses is drawn in (fire breathing); the top is open to the
	  room's air;
	- liquids fall into space below and level out sideways;
	- matter carries its heat wherever it moves, so energy is conserved
	  except at the faces that touch the room.

	Solids stay where they are. Deterministic: the same fills and steps give
	the same result.
