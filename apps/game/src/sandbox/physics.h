/*
	The rules between blocks of matter, shared by every place that runs them:
	the wiki's sandboxes (a dense little grid) and the world's own blocks
	(sparse, awake only where something's happening). One substrate, so what
	the wiki shows is what the world does.

	A block is a matter::Mixture filling a cube of `volume` m³: its solids and
	liquids take their volume by density, gas fills the rest at the pressure.
