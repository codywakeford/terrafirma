	The far view's tiling of an atlas planet (planning/sprint-32-atlas-lod.md):
	each region's own surface grid (a segment's, a cap's) as a quadtree, so a
	tile's cells are the atlas's cells, 2ᵏ×2ᵏ of them at level k, and at
	level 0 exactly the game's. A tile's key is its region (`face`: the
	grid's index in terragen::Atlas::grids), its level, and its place in the
	grid at that level, from the grid's low corner. Within a tile, as on the
	map, positions are in finest cells from the tile's corner, a cell centred
	on whole numbers; y is the layer. Geometry is the region's own chart
	(terragen::Atlas::at), so rows bend as the grid does.
