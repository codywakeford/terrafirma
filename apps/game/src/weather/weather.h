	A terra world's weather: Earth's fluid layer (src/fluid), its ground
	built from terragen's terrain (sea, land heights, how wet the soil starts)
	and anchored to terragen's climate (so seasons swing about the biomes'
	temperatures, while rain, wind and storms are the layer's own). Live
	state: stepped to the game clock, saved beside the world. Deterministic:
	the saved state and the clock give the same weather, so whatever happened
	after the last save is stepped again exactly.

	Time is model seconds: one game day is one model day (86400 s).
