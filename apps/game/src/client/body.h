/*
	The player's body (sprint 58): this client's own physics. The local
	player is a character in a physics::World of this client's, walking by
	physics::walk (inertia, a run that builds, a jump that's a height),
	standing on and riding what moves. Machines near it are in that world
	too, as the server has them (kinematic: they go where they're drawn), so
	the player meets them, stands on them and is carried. What the player
	carries is this client's to move till they let go: pulled toward their
	hands here as the server pulls it there, and drawn where it is here,
	so it's never a step behind the view.

	Gravity is the planet's field (sprint 59, orbit::Field): toward its
	centre, weaker with height, in the axes of the grid the player's in;
	its air drags. A velocity in the air is carried from place to place as
	the same motion, so a fast enough throw falls around the planet.

	Thrusting (sprint 59): flying, the aux1 key (Ctrl) hands the player to
	the body to fly by Newton: gravity and drag act, and the controls push
	(forward and back along the look, sideways, up and down along the
	grid's), harder the longer they're held; the brake pushes against the
	motion. Landing ends it and puts them on their feet.

	Luanti's movement still does what this doesn't yet: flying (until
	thrust), noclip, swimming and climbing. The body takes over again from
	wherever that left the player.
