/*
	The liquid layer (sprint 81): liquid lying in the world's open space,
	drawn on its own, never by remeshing map blocks. Each node's fill
	(fill::Fill, kept by its map block) is drawn as a surface over the
	node's open columns at the height that much liquid stands at, and sides
	where it stands above what's beside it, in its mixture's colour. The
	sea's full blocks are drawn here too, so it meets the shore's fills.

	Water near the camera (sprint 82) is a grid of columns, each with the
	ground under it and a depth of water, run as shallow water by virtual
	pipes (waves, sloshing, wakes) and drawn on the GPU from a texture of
	its heights, each top on a sixteenth. Two grids: a fine one a sixteenth
	wide round the camera, and a coarse one a quarter wide round that, so
	the water's alive further out for the same work. Only tiles something
	stirred are run. The server's amounts are the truth: a pond's water is
	held to what the server has in it and moves freely within it; the sea is
	a reservoir held at its level. Poured liquid falls as sixteenth-cube
	drops that land in it. Only a picture: nothing goes back to the server.
