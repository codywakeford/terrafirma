/*
	The tools in hand (sprints 45–46): out or away, which, how big, and
	whether strokes are mirrored. Held by the game; the page shows it and
	picks a tool by its id (sculpt::Kind::id).

	The page's rail asks for what the keys do (sprint 48): each ask waits
	here till the game takes it, where it knows what's pointed at.

	A tool is a brush (add, cut, paint, or a new part) and a shape (sprint
	53). Sprint 70: one build mode (Tab); parts are picked and worked on
	with the tools away, and their joints set from their menu.
