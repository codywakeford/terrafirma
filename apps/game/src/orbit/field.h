/*
	Gravity as a field (sprint 59): what pulls on something at a place in
	the map, in the map's own terms. The planet's pull toward its centre
	(weaker with height), the turning frame's pulls and its air, from each
	body's planet card (terragen::sphere at its radius), worked out in the
	planet's frame by Flight and given in the axes of the grid the place is
	in (planet::Atlas::frame).

	Those axes turn from place to place (up is the way out from the centre
	everywhere), so a velocity is only a velocity where it was measured:
	`carry` re-expresses one at a new place, as the same motion. That's what
	makes something thrown sideways fall around the planet rather than ride
	a grid's straight line.

	Without an atlas (a lab world, a flat map) it's the home card's pull
	straight down −y with height as y. Above the atlas's top it's charted
	from the column under it. In the seam between tiles there's no frame
	to give it in: it says so.
