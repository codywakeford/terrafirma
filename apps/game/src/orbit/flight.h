/*
	Flight on a planet: anything with mass moving under its gravity and
	through its air, pushed by thrust.

	Positions are planet-centred, in metres, in the frame that turns with the
	planet: a point on the ground stays put, a speed is over the ground, and
	the air (which turns with the ground) is still. +y is the north pole; at
	latitude φ, longitude λ the ground's normal is (cos φ sin λ, sin φ,
	cos φ cos λ), the same as the UI's globe. The turning frame adds its
	Coriolis and centrifugal pulls, so a launch eastward is helped by the
	spin, as on Earth.

	Near the ground, the game's blocks are a flat patch where a block is a
	metre (`near`): the same gravity and air, no curvature.
