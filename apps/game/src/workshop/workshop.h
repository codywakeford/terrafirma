	Workshop: what players make (sprints 48–52), the server's side of the
	tools in hand. Strokes on the world and on machines' parts, undoing
	them; machines made, held (kept still, posed by their holder) and let
	go to fall; a stroke drawn as a part of its own (a wheel: a cylinder,
	hinged), joints set between parts, two machines joined face to face,
	a part taken off or deleted; the library: a
	machine kept as a blueprint, placed again. In creative what's built
	follows the design. Each verb is for a player the caller has let use
	the tools (interact, creative), and throws Refused on what can't be.

	A machine is named here by its entity's object id (what the client
	points at), a part by its own id; the history keeps the machine's id,
	which lasts.
