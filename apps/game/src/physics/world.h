/*
	Physics (sprint 57): rigid bodies on Jolt Physics. A pure module: it
	knows boxes, densities, hinges and ground, never a machine, a node or
	an entity (the workshop compiles those into it).

	Units are the world's nodes (a node is a metre), the world's frame
	(node centres at whole numbers), seconds and kilograms. Positions are
	doubles: Jolt is built in double precision.

	An assembly is what a machine becomes: bodies (each a rigid group of
	parts) and hinges between them, all given in the assembly's own frame,
	whose origin and turn are its pose. Its bodies never collide with each
	other. It's Live (simulated) or Frozen (kept as a pose, out of Jolt):
	the tier (planning/simulation-scales.md). Held, it's kinematic: moved
	where its holder says, pushing what it meets.

	Characters (sprint 58) are Jolt's virtual characters: capsules that walk
	by collide-and-slide, up steps, over slopes, standing on (and carried by)
	what moves, pushing bodies as hard as they're strong. A character moves
	at the velocity it's given (its controller's: physics/walk.h), or is
	placed (a player whose client moves them: it pushes on its way there).
	Carried, an assembly is pulled toward where it's to be as hard as its
	carrier can: light things follow, heavy ones lag or drag.
	Grabbed (sprint 68), a point of it is pulled toward a hand as hard as
	its grabber can: a light thing comes up, a heavy one turns about the
	point or tips, what's too heavy barely gives. Many can grab one.

	Gravity and air are a field (sprint 59), asked at each body and
	character every step: a planet's pull points at its centre and weakens
	with height, its air drags on everything that moves.

	Ground is asked of the caller a map block (16³ nodes) at a time, and
	only round Live assemblies and characters.

	Deterministic: one thread, a fixed step; the same calls give the same
	bodies, bit for bit.
