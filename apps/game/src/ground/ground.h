	Ground: the shape natural loose ground takes. Undisturbed loose ground
	(dirt, sand, gravel, snow, clay: the `loose` group) is a height field
	to a sixteenth of a block, drawn and stood on in voxels of a sixteenth. Nothing is stored: a loose block
	with nothing walkable over it takes its shape from the columns round
	it, every time it's asked.

	The field is at column corners, where four columns meet. A corner's
	height, for one column, is the average of the surfaces of the columns
	there that are within a block of each other (its cluster): a step of
	one block is a ramp, a drop of two a cliff. It's never lowered under
	the column's own surface where a column there is higher, or solid at
	the same height: a face hidden against a full block stays hidden. A
	function of the four columns alone, so every column at a corner, in
	any map block, agrees.

	A column's top block is only lowered within its own cell; where the
	ground rises it fills into the air cell above it (up to a block).
