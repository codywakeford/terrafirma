/*
	The atlas (terragen::Atlas, planet.paper.md) in the engine's map: where
	each of its cells is stored, as a node.

	The rule the layout keeps, as the cube's net does: a plain step from a
	stored node (p + dir) is the true neighbour or the seam, never some
	other cell. Every region's grid (a segment, a cap, the core) is one box
	of the map, walled by a map block of seam: x its i (east), y its k (up:
	the layer, so the sea is where the engine expects it), z its j (north).
	A grid's trimmed cells are seam too.

	Tiles (planning/sprint-39-tiles.md): a grid is stored in tiles of TILE ×
	TILE cells (i, j; on the grid's own multiples of TILE, so a tile is the
	same whatever the planet's extent). The map is a window onto them: SLOTS
	× SLOTS slots, a map block of seam between, each holding a tile or
	none (the window: which tile is where, shared by every copy of the
	atlas; the server moves tiles in and out as players go, clients
	follow). A tile sits in its slot as it sits in its square of the grid,
	so a map block is the same 16 cells wherever the tile is. Crossing from
	tile to tile is crossing a seam, with no turn. Down, a tile keeps the
	crust: CRUST layers under the sea; below, seam (the planet's floor). The
	core is stored only where the crust reaches it.

	A node's spot is where it is on the planet whatever slot it's in: its
	region's grid at a fixed origin in a plane of 32-bit positions. What's
	made at a node (its rock, its caves) and where a block is saved are
	found from its spot, never from where the window put it.

	Crossing between regions is the atlas's (terragen::Atlas::neighbours):
	Map::next and Map::see go through it, never p + dir.
