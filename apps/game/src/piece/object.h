	An object (sprint 49): a thing made off the world's grid, a cart or a
	pot. It's two pieces on the one grid: its design (what the tools edit,
	what a blueprint keeps) and what's built of it. What's designed and
	not built is drawn a ghost: in survival, what's left to make; in
	creative there's none, what's built follows the design.

	Its id is its own and lasts (undo names it by it); its entity's object
	id is only for now. Its text is "TFO1", the id, the design's and the
	built piece's text; a piece's text from before (TFP1, TFP2) reads as
	one built as designed.
