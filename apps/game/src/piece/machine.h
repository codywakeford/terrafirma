/*
	A machine (sprint 52): parts, each an object (a design and what's built
	of it) set in the machine's grid, and the joints between them. A cart's
	chassis, its axles, its wheels. One entity carries it, and it moves and
	falls as one; a hinge's part is free to turn about its axle (when
	there's something to turn it: sprint 53).

	A part sits at an offset turned one of the 24 square turns: every
	part's sixteenths are the machine's, so the tools, and parts joined
	face to face, are exact. Points are in sixteenths from a grid's corner
	(node (0, 0, 0)'s least): a part's sixteenth (n, c) spans 16n + c to
	16n + c + 1; the first part's are the machine's.

	Its text is "TFM5" (sprint 75: each joint's spring, how far it travels and how firm; TFM4 had none: sprint 73's
	joint kinds are new numbers in it), its id, its parts, its joints, its sockets, its
	front (TFM3 had no front: its grid's +z; TFM2 had no sockets; TFM1, sprint 52, had what each part was made as: read
	past). An object's text
	(TFO1) or a piece's from before reads as a machine of one part.
