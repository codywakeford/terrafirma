/*
	The planet as blocks: layout v2 (planet.paper.md, section 2).

	A handful of regions, each one Cartesian grid from the surface down to
	the core:
	- Segments: N wedges between meridians, cap circle to cap circle. A row
	  follows the centre meridian exactly (its latitude is j / radius); east,
	  a row runs along the great circle square to that meridian, rounded:
	  partway (`rounding`) from a flat line to the circle itself, so blocks
	  keep their width going down and neighbouring grids overlap at the seam.
	- Caps: poleward of capLatitude, a grid on each pole, rounded the same
	  way out from the pole.
	- Core: inside `core` blocks of the centre, one plain Cartesian grid.
	Every place belongs to one region (its territory: by radius, latitude and
	longitude); a grid's cells are those that reach into its territory, and
	the rest are trimmed. Cells the territory's edge cuts are cut cells.

	Planet frame: y to the north pole (the spin axis), x to longitude 0 on
	the equator, z to 90° east. Layer k is about the radii
	[radius + k, radius + k + 1).
