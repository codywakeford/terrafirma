/*
	The climate: where rain falls and when, from the air rather than from
	noise. The same physics as the live weather (src/fluid), solved for its
	long-run state instead of stepped through time, in fixed point so a world
	code gives the same climate everywhere.

	- The circulation by rule: Held & Hou's Hadley cells, Rhines' jets
	  beyond them (circulate, shared with the fluid layer).
	- Ocean currents: wind-driven gyres, warm poleward off east coasts and
	  cold toward the equator off west coasts, warming or chilling the sea
	  and the coasts, and drying the air over cold water.
	- Two seasons, each with the rising branch (the ITCZ) following the sun,
	  and thermal lows over summer continents drawing sea air in (monsoons).
	- Moisture evaporates from warm sea (and is recycled by wet land),
	  travels with the mean winds, and rains out where air rises (the ITCZ,
	  the polar front, slopes facing the wind, hot land) and is held where it
	  sinks (the dry belts, the lee of mountains).
