	The planet as the things that move on it see it: its size, its pull, its
	spin and its air. One card, read by the climate, the weather layer and
	flight (src/orbit), so they agree on the body they share.

	The world's blocks are a map of it (World::u, v): the map wraps the whole
	planet in `WorldCode::size` blocks, so a block across is far more than a
	metre of planet. Heights and speeds near the ground are the game's own
	(a block is a metre); above the flight ceiling, flight runs on the card.
