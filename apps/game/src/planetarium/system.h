	The rest of a body's system, round it (planning/sprint-35-system.md): the
	star, the other planets and moons, their orbits. In the focused body's
	units (blocks, its centre the origin; the system's km × blocksPerKm),
	each drawn relative to the camera in doubles. Every body is drawn at the
	detail its distance calls for: a lit sphere coloured by its kind, or a
	dot where it would be under a couple of pixels; the star a bright sphere
	and a glow, the light all the spheres are lit by. Behind it all, a field
	of stars; each orbit in its body's colour, bright where the body has just
	been and fading round to where it's going (the hovered one brightest). Far to near, each body
	with its own depth range, so the far side of the system and the ground
	under the camera share one frame. The focused body is drawn by whoever
	owns it (the Planetarium: its tiles), in its turn.
