	A camera in orbit round a body, looking down at its centre: the way from
	the centre to it, the screen's up across that, and how high above the sea
	it is. In the body's own frame (its ground's), so the ground stays still
	under it however the body spins. Dragging rolls it round the body like a
	ball under the hand, slower the lower it is (the ground under it moves at
	about the same speed on screen), over the poles as anywhere: nothing
	keeps north up but focus. Zooming moves it up and down, from a few body
	radii out to 100 blocks over the sea. In doubles; what it gives the GPU
	is relative to itself, in floats.
