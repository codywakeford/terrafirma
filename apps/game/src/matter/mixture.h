	A mixture: amounts of substances (moles), with a temperature, at the
	pressure its surroundings hold it at. Its properties come from what's in
	it. Stepping it runs every reaction whose conditions are met, at its rate,
	and balances energy: reaction heat, latent heat as substances change
	state, and heat exchanged with the surroundings. The same primitive at
	every scale — a crucible, a room's air, an ocean, an atmosphere.

	Changes of state take their time: a substance crossing its melting or
	boiling point is split between the two states and the mixture stays at
	that temperature until the heat to finish (or undo) the change has come
	(ice in a warm room sits at 0 °C until it has melted). Matter added in
	another state than what's there resolves the same way (steam meeting cold
	water condenses, warming it).
