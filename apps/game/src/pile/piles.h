	The world's moving ground (sprint 84), on the server. What presses on
	loose ground (wheels, feet) wakes a region round it: a box of nodes read
	into a field (each column's surface from the nodes' solid sixteenths:
	cut, smoothed, or whole), pressed and run there, and written back into
	the map as cut shapes a few times a second while it moves, so the
	clients, collision and digging see it as any cut ground. A region with
	nothing moving in it for a second is written and let go: asleep, the
	ground is just the map's.

	A region is one material (the ground pressed): others in it are its
	floor and walls.
