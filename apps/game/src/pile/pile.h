	Piles (sprint 84): loose ground that moves. A field of columns a
	sixteenth of a node wide, each with bonded ground that stays (its floor)
	and a depth of loose grains over it, in sixteenths. No grains, no
	velocities: where a column stands higher over its neighbour than the
	material rests at, the excess slides downhill and stops. It settles in a
	handful of steps, so it sleeps almost at once.

	Everything is integers in a fixed order, so the server and the client,
	from the same piles, reach the same ground: the server's is the truth
	(it's stood on, driven on, dug), the client runs the same rule to
	predict its own pushes and is corrected.

	Sixteenths, not finer: the world keeps ground as cut shapes, so a slope
	that only rests between sixteenths would slide again each time it's
	read back. A material rests at a whole step a column (or flat).
